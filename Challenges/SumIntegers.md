# Sum of Integers Challengs

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target value target, write a function to return the indices of two numbers such that they add up to the target. You may assume that each input has exactly one solution, and you cannot use the same element twice.

You can assume:

- The array nums contains at least two elements.
- The elements in nums are unique (no duplicates).
- The target value target is a valid integer.

## Example

Input:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9

Output:
[0, 1]
