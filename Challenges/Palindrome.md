# Palindrome Challenge 
Given a string s, determine if it is a valid palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring any non-alphanumeric characters and considering case-insensitivity.

## Assume
You can assume:

- The input string s consists only of printable ASCII characters.
- The string may contain alphanumeric characters and/or punctuation, which should be ignored when determining if it is a palindrome.
- An empty string is considered a valid palindrome.

### Example:
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true

**Explanation**: The string "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a valid palindrome as it reads the same forwards and backwards after ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and case.

Write pseudo code for an algorithm that solves this problem efficiently.
